## Improve quality of preschool education

*   Develop our Early Childhood teaching force by increasing salaries for educators in MOE Kindergartens by up to 10%, and educators in anchor operator preschools by up to 30%
*   Revised Nurturing Early Learners Framework to provide updated guidelines for quality teaching and learning
*   This includes stronger emphasis on developing childrenâ€™s values, social and emotional competencies, and learning dispositions

## Enhance accessibility of preschool education

*   60 MOE Kindergartens by 2027, up from 50 today, to provide parents with more preschool choices
*   Income ceiling for priority admission to MKs raised to $4500 for gross household income, or $1125 per capita income, to ensure MKs remain accessible to lower-income households
