## Full SBB: Greater customisation and flexibility in learning

*   From the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, Full SBB will be implemented across secondary schools
*   Streaming will be phased out and students will start Sec 1 in one of three Posting Groups â€“ Posting Group 1, 2, and 3
*   Posting Groups will only be used for the purposes of facilitating entry into secondary school and to guide the subject levels students offer at the start of Secondary 1
*   Students will be in mixed form classes comprising students from different Posting Groups
*   This gives students more opportunities to interact with peers of different backgrounds, strengths, and interests
*   Under Full SBB, students will also have greater flexibility to customise their learning suited to their strengths, interests and learning needs
*   They can adjust their subject levels across their secondary school journey, based on their subject-specific strengths and learning needs
*   From 2024, more subjects, like Humanities subjects, can be taken at a more demanding level. Students may also offer some subjects at a less demanding level, including elective subjects at the upper secondary level
*   As part of the shift to Full SBB, MOE will also provide more opportunities for students to take up subjects and programmes that are stream-based today
*   No more N-Level and O-Level certs: From 2027 graduating cohort, students will instead sit for a common Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate
*   The existing JC admission criteria remains relevant and will be retained
*   Option of fifth year for students who wish to offer G3 subjects in fifth year to pace learning remains

## More meaningful partnerships between mainstream and SPED schools

*   Deepen partnerships between all SPED schools and selected mainstream schools under the School Partnership model
*   This will be done by providing social interaction opportunities for students through joint CCAs, recess, workshops, and camps
*   These partnerships help to nurture inclusivity and support SPED students in integrating into society

## Improving quality of SPED education

*   Two new SPED Teaching and Learning Syllabuses to teach communication and social-emotional skills
*   To help students live independently, learn continuously, and work productively after they leave school
