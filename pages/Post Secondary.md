#### With Full SBB, students will study a more diverse combination of subjects at different subject levels by the time they complete secondary school

We have thus reviewed the admissions criteria for post-secondary pathways to recognise a wider profile of learners and provide students with more options, while ensuring they continue to have strong fundamentals and can thrive in their chosen pathway.

## More paths, and more porosity in between

*   Polytechnics to be more accessible to a wider profile of students
*   Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) no longer limited to N(A) students.
*   From AY2028, more students, including those taking G3 subjects or a mix of G3 and G2 subjects can join the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP)
*   PFP students can choose a cluster of interest instead of a specific diploma, from 2026 

## A-Level curriculum to be revised

*   From 2026, only 3 H2 content-based subjects will count towards the University Admission Score (UAS) by default. Fourth content-based subject included only if it improves score
*   No more mid-year exams for JCs and Millennia Institute progressively, starting with the cohort entering in 2024
*   Project Work will be a Pass/Fail subject
*   From 2024, all JC1 students will be required to study General Paper (GP), which will be delinked from Knowledge & Inquiry (KI)
*   KI remains a H2 contrasting subject for both Arts and Science

## Increased opportunities for ITE grads to deepen skills and competencies

*   Transition of ITE’s 3-year Higher Nitec structure is under way, and will be completed by the 2026 ITE intake
*   ITE’s Work-Study Diplomas (WSDips), Technical Diplomas (TDs) and Technical Engineer Diplomas (TEDs) will be expanded
