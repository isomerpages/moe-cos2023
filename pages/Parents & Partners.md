#### We need strong partnerships with all stakeholders, including parents, community partners and agencies

## Partnering parents for the child’s well-being

*   We will partner parents as they seek to strengthen relationships with their children
*   Increase students’ exposure to workplaces through parents as links between schools and industry
*   We will partner with Parent Support Groups, COMmunity and Parents in Support of Schools (COMPASS) council, agencies, community partners, subject matter experts and experienced parents to sustain existing efforts and create new resources to support our students’ well-being based on their education journey and life stages

## Support disadvantaged students

*   Nationwide roll-out of UPLIFT Community Network, schools and community partners to coordinate resources to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds
*   In collaboration with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the UCN aims to benefit around 1,300 students in 110 schools, up from 900 students in 89 schools last year
