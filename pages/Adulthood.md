#### MOE is committed to building a culture of lifelong learning and equipping Singaporeans with the skills they need to thrive in school and at work

To this end, we need to build on partnerships with the industry, unions, community and parents.

### More adult learners in university

*   The “Lifetime Cohort Participation Rate” will increase to 60% for publicly-funded university degrees by 2025, up from 50% today, for fresh school leavers and adult learners
*   The increase of the “Lifetime Cohort Participation Rate” marks a shift away from the idea that education must be frontloaded
*   More Singaporeans can study in university or upgrade their skills at a stage in their life that is most suitable to them
*   The Autonomous Universities are developing new degree pathways and innovating the design and delivery of Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes
*   More subsidised places for adults to do pre-employment training and CET programmes

### Matchmaking jobs with skilled jobseekers

*   To better address job-skills mismatches and pair jobseekers with job vacancies in sectors that face more acute training and placement challenges, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), together with Workforce Singapore (WSG), Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) and Economic Development Board (EDB), will pilot the Jobs-Skills Integrator (JSIT)
*   3 sectors to have Jobs-Skills Integrator pilots: Precision engineering, retail, and wholesale trade
*   So IHLs, training providers, and employers can create training opportunities and find good employer-employee matches
*   SSG, the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE), and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) will also jointly launch the Workplace Skills Recognition (WPSR) Programme
*   Enterprises under this programme will have the opportunity to obtain the new Workplace Learning:READY (WPL:READY) mark, which ensures they have robust processes to enable effective on-the-job learning and help their workers gain formal recognition of the skills they have developed at the workplace
